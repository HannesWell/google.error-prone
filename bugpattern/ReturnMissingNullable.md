## The problem
Annotating a method `@Nullable` communicates to tools that the method can return
null. That means they can check that callers handle a returned null correctly.

Adding `@Nullable` may require updating callers so that they deal with the
possibly-null value. This can happen for example with Kotlin callers, or with
Java callers that are checked for null-safety by static-analysis tools.
Alternatively, depending on the tool, it may be possible to annotate Java
callers temporarily with `@SuppressWarnings("nullness")`.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("ReturnMissingNullable")` to the enclosing element.
